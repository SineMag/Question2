# Question2
# Making wise career choices
Besides the know fact that the data engineering field is growing and in great demand, I just love working with numbers. 
Whether I’m proving a formula, solving for x, or making sound deductions from long questions. 
There is a joy in me that comes after I know I’ve done it again! I call it the ‘mathattack’ (mathematical attack). This is when I solve something with understanding, especially one that looks extremely tough. 
I chose this journey because I qualify, not just in paper but also in practice and dedication. Also, I need to prove that my mind is more capable. 
This is the part where I say great things about me! Hence, I make wise career decisions by applying for a data engineering program.
